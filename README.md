# Webwright: The Ghost in Your Shell 👻💻

Webwright is more than just a terminal shell—it's a transformative tool that gets things done, plain and simple.

In the early days of computing, the command line was king. Webwright is for the tinkerers and hackers who remember that raw power. It taps into that primal, user-first ethos, acting as a ghost in your shell: an AI that speaks your language and understands your needs.

With Webwright, you're in control. Generate code, manage projects, deploy apps, and automate tasks—all from your terminal. It's the tool that puts power back in your hands.

This is computing at its rawest, most powerful, and most liberating.

Are you ready to unleash the ghost in your shell?

## 🔑 API Requirements

Webwright requires an API token from either OpenAI or Anthropic to function. You can obtain these tokens from:

- [OpenAI API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
- [Anthropic API Keys](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys)

Please ensure you have at least one of these API keys before proceeding with the installation.

## Getting Started

Once installed, you can start using Webwright by simply typing `webwright` in your terminal. Here's a quick overview of some commands:

### Open URLs in Your Browser

```bash
open hackernews
```

### Create a New Project

```bash
create project my-project
```

### Generate Code

```bash
generate code --type python --output my_script.py
```

### Commit to GitHub

```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

### Start Docker Containers

```bash
docker start my-container
```

### AI-Powered Code Generation

Webwright can generate complex code snippets using AI. For example, to generate an ASCII fractal:

```bash
generate fractal --size 20
```

### Example: Fractal Generation

Here's an example of a Python code snippet generated by Webwright to create a mandlebrot fractal:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Function to compute the Mandelbrot set
def mandelbrot(c, max_iter):
    z = c
    for n in range(max_iter):
        if abs(z) > 2:
            return n
        z = z*z + c
    return max_iter

# Generate the fractal
def generate_fractal(size):
    # Determine the plot boundaries
    x_min, x_max = -2.5, 1.5
    y_min, y_max = -2.0, 2.0

    width, height = (size*100, size*100)  # Increase resolution by multiplying size by 100
    x, y = np.linspace(x_min, x_max, width), np.linspace(y_min, y_max, height)
    fractal = np.zeros((width, height))

    for i in range(width):
        for j in range(height):
            fractal[i, j] = mandelbrot(complex(x[i], y[j]), 256)

    plt.imshow(fractal.T, extent=[x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max], cmap='hot')
    plt.colorbar()
    plt.title("Mandelbrot Fractal")
    plt.show()

# Generate a fractal of the given size
generate_fractal(20)

```
